## Game Overview
In this game, the player will be given a series of tilted pictures wrapped in different colors of frames. The player's goal is to straighten the pictures as fast as he can. Pictures with different frames have different rotation rules. There will also be a timer on the top right corner to make you sweat! Feeling interested? Let's dig in!

## Walkthrough
- **Entry Page**  
  The entry page is divided into 2 sections: the lower part is the main section, which will display all the pictures later after the game starts. The upper part is the control panel, which includes a 'How to Play?' button to onboard users who are new to the game, a 'Start!' button, which kickstarts the game right away, and a timer (only appear after game starts)

 - **Game Instructions**  
  Once the player click the how to play button, a game instruction will popup.
  The rule of the game is simple: use the arrow key to rotate and confirm the pictures:
	  - For üü®-frame pictures: press left arrow key to rotate anti-clockwise, right arrow key to rotate clockwise. Once the picture is straightened, press down arrow key to confirm and move to the next picture.
	  - For ‚¨ú-frame pictures: the control is just the opposite. Use left arrow key to rotate clockwise and right arrow key to rotate anti-clockwise. Similarly, press down arrow key to confirm once the picture is straightened.
	  - For ‚¨õ-frame pictures: press the up arrow key to remove the picture directly from the list. ‚ùóÔ∏èIf the player accidentally press other arrow keys, the picture will be locked for 3 seconds.
